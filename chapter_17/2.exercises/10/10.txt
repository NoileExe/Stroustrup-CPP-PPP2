std::ifstream
typedef basic_ifstream<char> ifstream;
Input file stream class
ios_base

istream
ifstream

Input stream class to operate on files.

Objects of this class maintain a filebuf object as their internal stream buffer, which performs input/output operations on the file they are associated with (if any).

File streams are associated with files either on construction, or by calling member open.

This is an instantiation of basic_ifstream with the following template parameters:
template parameter	definition	comments
charT	char	Aliased as member char_type
traits	char_traits<char>	Aliased as member traits_type

Apart from the internal file stream buffer, objects of this class keep a set of internal fields inherited from ios_base, ios and istream:

field	member functions	description
Formatting	format flags	flags
setf
unsetf	A set of internal flags that affect how certain input/output operations are interpreted or generated.
See member type fmtflags.
field width	width	Width of the next formatted element to insert.
display precision	precision	Decimal precision for the next floating-point value inserted.
locale	getloc
imbue	The locale object used by the function for formatted input/output operations affected by localization properties.
fill character	fill	Character to pad a formatted field up to the field width (width).
State	error state	rdstate
setstate
clear	The current error state of the stream.
Individual values may be obtained by calling good, eof, fail and bad.
See member type iostate.
exception mask	exceptions	The state flags for which a failure exception is thrown.
See member type iostate.
Other	callback stack	register_callback	Stack of pointers to functions that are called when certain events occur.
extensible arrays	iword
pword
xalloc	Internal arrays to store objects of type long and void*.
tied stream	tie	Pointer to output stream that is flushed before each i/o operation on this stream.
stream buffer	rdbuf	Pointer to the associated streambuf object, which is charge of all input/output operations.
character count	gcount	Count of characters read by last unformatted input operation.

Member types
The class declares the following member types:
member type	definition
char_type	char
traits_type	char_traits<char>
int_type	int
pos_type	streampos
off_type	streamoff
